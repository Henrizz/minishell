This program is a collaboration between Stephanie @StephVibes and Henriette @Henrizz.
It is our submission to the 42 Berlin school project called MINISHELL, which is about creating our own shell, with bash as behavioural reference.

When running our minishell by starting ./minishell, you will be able to execute the following cases, among others: 

- run system commands with path or without path (e.g. /usr/bin/ls or ls)

- run the following builtin commands:
◦ echo with option -n
◦ cd with a relative or absolute path, and with - and --
◦ pwd (without options)
◦ export (without options)
◦ unset (without options)
◦ env (without options or arguments)
◦ exit (without options)

- redirect input or output with <, >, <<, >> over one or several files or heredocs

- run piped commands

- expand variables in the commands, filenames and heredoc input

ENJOY !
